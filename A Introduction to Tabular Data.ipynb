    "    * Discrete values without inherent order\n",
    "    * E.g., colors (red, blue, green), identifiers, occupation, gender\n",

    "2. Ordinal\n",
    "    * Discrete values with inherent order\n",

    "    * No guarantee that the difference between values is same\n",
    "    * Often ints or strings (but could be any data type)\n",
    "3. Interval\n",
    "    * Values measured on a scale of equal-sized widths\n",
    "    * Unlike ordinal, can compare and quantify difference between values\n",

    "* Labeled data implies an attribute that classifies instances (e.g., mpg)\n",
    "    * Goal is typically to predict the class for new instances\n",
    "    * This is called \"Supervised Learning\"\n",
    "* Unlabeled means there isn't such an attribute (for mining purposes)\n",
    "    * Can still find patterns, associations, etc.\n",
    "    * Generally referred to as \"Unsupervised Learning\""
