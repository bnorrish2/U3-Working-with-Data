    "It is not uncommon to have datasets with noisy, invalid, or completely missing values.\n",
    "1. Noisy vs Invalid Values\n",
    "    * Noisy implies the value is correct, just recorded incorrectly\n",
    "        * E.g., decimal place error (5.72 instead of 57.2), wrong categorical value used\n",
    "    * Invalid implies a noisy value that is not a valid value (for domain)\n",
    "        * E.g., 57.2X, misspelled categorical data, or value out of range (6 on a 5 point scale)\n",
    "    * Ways to deal with this:\n",
    "        * Look for duplicates (when there shouldn't be)\n",
    "        * Look for outliers\n",
    "        * Sort and print range of values\n",
    "    * The term \"noisy\" may also imply random error or random variance\n",
    "        * Various techniques to \"smooth out\" values\n",
    "        * E.g., using means of bins or regression\n",
    "2. Missing Values\n",
    "     * How should we deal with missing values?\n",
    "        * Discard instances: throw out any row with a missing value\n",
    "        * Replace with a new value:\n",
    "            * By hand\n",
    "            * Use a constant\n",
    "            * Use a central tendency measure (mean, median, most frequent, ...)\n",
    "        * Most \"probable\" value (e.g., regression, using a classifier)\n",
    "        * Replace either across data set, or based on similar instances\n",

    "Missing values are usually coded as an out of range value, such as an empty string in a text field, -1 in a numeric field that is normally positive, or 0 in a numeric field that cannot take on the value of 0. In the Scipy ecosystem, the common value `NaN` (not a number) is used to denote missing data. There is support in the Scipy libraries to handle `NaN` specially. For example, the Pandas function [`isnull()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.isnull.html) returns a Boolean array detecting the `NaN` values element-wise and [`dropna()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.dropna.html) removes `NaN` values from a series or data frame:\n"
